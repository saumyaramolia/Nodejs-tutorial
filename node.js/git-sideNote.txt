When dealing with different packages there size is in mbs.
So to avoid that you add ".gitignore".
This will ignore the files/floders you dont want to upload.
Syntax for that is: 
    - /<fileName/floderName>

And also if your are cloning your repo or someone's repo and they have a .gitignore
 so to access there dependecies just type in your terminal "npm install" command
 this will instantly add all the dependecies needed.

That works because it checks package.json and then installs the packages.
